# dna-chain
A very simple ada program to practice IO and package definition

A DNA chain has 2 components: *base chain* and *complementary chain*.  
The base chain it's composed of elements, which can be *T, C, G or A*.  
The complementary chain it's created following DNA Transformation's rules: `T <-> A` and `G <-> C`.
 Â 
### Example
* Base chain: *TTAGCT*
* Comp chain: *AATCGA* 

This ada program let's you type a base chain and it composes it's complementary.  
The result it's written into a file.
